# Product Requirements Document: Simple Jira Clone MVP

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the minimum viable product (MVP) for a simple task tracking application, intended to function as a basic Jira clone. The goal is to provide core functionality for a small team to manage their work items effectively.

## 2. Goals

*   Enable a team of up to 20 users to track tasks.
*   Provide a central place to create, view, and update work items.
*   Focus on core task management without complex workflows or features.
*   Develop a stable foundation for future enhancements.

## 3. User Stories (Core MVP)

*   As a user, I want to create a new task with a title and description so that I can capture a work item.
*   As a user, I want to assign a task to another user so that ownership is clear.
*   As a user, I want to update the status of a task (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done) so that the team knows its current state.
*   As a user, I want to view a list of all tasks so that I can see the team's workload.
*   As a user, I want to see basic details of a task (title, assignee, status) in the list view.

## 4. Features (MVP)

*   **Task Creation:**
    *   Fields: Title (text), Description (multiline text), Type (dropdown: Bug, Feature, Task - simple set), Assignee (text input or simple dropdown of known users), Status (dropdown: To Do, In Progress, Done).
*   **Task Viewing:**
    *   List view showing Title, Assignee, Status.
    *   Ability to click a task to see full details (including description).
*   **Task Updating:**
    *   Edit all fields of an existing task.
*   **User Management (Simplified for MVP):**
    *   Assume users are pre-configured or managed externally for this phase. Assignee field is a simple string for now.
*   **Authentication/Authorization (Simplified for MVP):**
    *   Basic authentication sufficient for 20 users (e.g., Supabase Auth). No complex permissions needed for MVP.

## 5. Non-Goals (for MVP)

*   Comments or activity streams on tasks.
*   Attachments.
*   Rich text editing in descriptions.
*   Sprints or agile boards (Kanban/Scrum views).
*   Complex workflows or custom fields.
*   Notifications (email, in-app).
*   Reporting or analytics.
*   User avatars or profiles.
*   Permissions beyond basic system access.
*   Integrations with other tools (Git, Slack, etc.).
*   Advanced searching or filtering.

## 6. Technical Considerations (MVP)

*   **Backend/Database:** Utilize Supabase for database, authentication, and potentially real-time updates (Supabase MCP).
*   **Frontend:** Use Next.js (Context7 MCP for latest info). Keep UI framework simple.
*   **Scalability:** Focus on functionality for 20 users. Optimizations for large scale are out of scope for MVP.

## 7. Success Metrics (MVP)

*   Team of 20 users can successfully create, assign, update status, and view their tasks.
*   Application is stable and usable for daily task tracking within the team.

## 8. Future Scope (Beyond MVP)

(Briefly mention that features from Section 5 will be considered for future phases based on feedback and needs.)
