description: 'Initiate development for the Simple Jira Clone MVP.'
---
Alright team, let's start building the Simple Jira Clone MVP.

Our goal is to implement the core features outlined in `prd_mvp.md`.

Please review the requirements in `prd_mvp.md` and the development instructions in `instructions_mvp.instructions.md`.

Consult the `development_tasks.md` file to see the initial high-level plan.

Using `SEQUENTIAL_THINKING_MCP`, propose the very first technical step or file we should create based on the `prd_mvp.md`. For example, maybe setting up the Supabase client or creating the main tasks list page.

Remember to use the relevant MCPs as described in the instructions file, and **update `development_tasks.md` using `TASK_MANAGER_MCP`** as you complete steps.
